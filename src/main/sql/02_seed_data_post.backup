They have a great 30 day trial which worked out really well for my seven day driving trip.</p>\n\n<p>I also tried out Google Navigator whilst in France, but it has a fundamental difference in the way it works. I think it is a flaw. The voice over tells you to turn right into xxx street. The problem is that it assumes that you can see your Android screen and that you know the street names, or are able to see them.</p>\n\n<p>By contrast, Navigon will say that you need to turn right in xxx metres into xxx street. This is very helpful when you are just listening to the directions as opposed to watching them. Navigon also stores all of the maps on your SD card so it doesn't require a data plan to use, although the trial requires data access when you start the application. It can then be turned off.</p>\n\n<p>I find that when driving in sunlight you cannot actually see what is on the screen due to glare (at least with the HTC phones).

Each paragraph of text was a single line and each file had Unix-style line endings (line feeds).  I first changed it so that each paragraph was formatted with LFs in all the right places; each text editor displayed exactly 1 more character than previous, in terms of the text (it was many more characters in terms of bytes, though, given all of the added LFs.

The tablets will be in the hands of operators, who we do not want to be able to use the data connection for anything but our web-based application.

1841	\N	\N	<p>I have a Nexus One full of songs and when I go to my friend's house I would like to play songs off of it.  Since I have my phone connect to my friend's WiFi, the phone has a local IP.

1852	\N	\N	<p>The interaction between Google Talk via Gmail and Google Talk via the Android client seems confusing. Here's my understanding of how things work:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>If a chat is started in Gmail, it will sync in (near) real-time to Talk.</li>\n<li>If a chat is started in Talk, it will show up in the chat history in Gmail, but will not spawn a new chat in Gmail (so the chat is confined to Talk).</li>\n<li>If a chat is started in Gmail, and continued in Talk, messages will stop being sent to the chat in Gmail, and new messages will be sent to Talk (as well as the chat history in Gmail). In my (short) experience, this transition can be a bit flaky.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Is this basically how it works? What I'd love to see is a perfect 1:1 sync between Gmail and Talk. That is, if I start a chat in Talk, it will create a new chat tab in Gmail, and everything will get pushed to both, and vice-versa.</p>\n\n<p>Anyone know if that's in the pipeline, or even possible now? How does everyone else handle moving as seamlessly as possible between Gmail and Talk?</p>\n\n<p>Thanks!</p>\n	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	How do Gmail (desktop) and Talk (Android) chats interact?	\N

1878	\N	\N	<p>Android has a nifty feature to disable auto-rotation... Is there some sort of gesture or key combination to rotate your screen? (Say I am in a browser and want to rotate). The idea is to be on auto-rotate = off (mostly desired) and manually change the <em>orientation</em> when needed without exiting the application (preferably).</p>\n\n<p>Edit:</p>\n\n<p>I just realized how unclear my original post was, I corrected it now to be more clear.</p>\n	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	Can I manually rotate my phone while auto-rotation is disabled?	\N

However the programming API suggests that it should be able to connect automatically - how can I configure my phone to do that?</p>\n\n<p>I have a Nexus One with Android 2.2.</p>\n\n<p>Edit: Thank you for your comments.
